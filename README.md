### Introduction

I conducted a sales analysis project using data provided by Superstore Company and analyzed it using Tableau software. The data was organized by year, product category, and customer state, and I utilized various visualization tools such as correlation matrix, line charts, and pie charts to identify patterns and trends in the data. These visualizations allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the sales performance and provided valuable insights for further exploration of the data.

The purpose of this project is to analyze sales data based on year, product category, and customer state to identify trends and opportunities for growth. The total sales for all categories from 2019 to 2023 are currently at 376,368. The data reveals that 2022 has the highest sales amount with increased sales in electronics and home appliances.

### Results

The analysis showed that technology had the highest sales from 2019 to 2023, but in 2022, all categories experienced the highest sales. Additionally, California, Texas, Mass, and New York were the top-selling states, with office supplies, technology, and furniture being the top categories. The project also highlighted opportunities for growth by increasing marketing efforts in the Midwest and expanding the fashion category's product offerings.

However, the average profit from 2019 to 2023 has been decreasing, as well as sales. The average profit per order in 2023 is lower than the average profit per order in 2019.

### Conclusion

The analysis of the sales data provides valuable insights for the company to make data-driven decisions and identify areas for growth. The findings suggest that the company should focus on increasing profits and sales by implementing strategies such as improving the pricing strategy, increasing marketing efforts in the Midwest, and expanding the product offerings in the fashion category. By doing so, the company can improve its overall performance and stay competitive in the market.
